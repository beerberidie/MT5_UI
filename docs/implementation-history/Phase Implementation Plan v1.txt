Phase Implementation Plan: Trading Dashboard & AI Analysis System
Phase 0 — UI/UX Scaling (Preparation)

Goal: Reduce the entire UI/UX by ~10% without changing functionality.
Tasks:

Apply a global scaling factor of 90% to all sections (Dashboard, Analysis, Settings, Activity).

Verify that text, buttons, charts, and tables resize correctly and remain readable.

Ensure Pending Orders display is fully visible after scaling.
Dependencies: None (can be done immediately).
Priority: High (prevents display issues for all other phases).

Phase 1 — Analysis Section (Structure & Placeholders)

Goal: Build the framework for the Analysis section and AI module.
Tasks:

Create Analysis section UI:

Same layout style as Settings section.

Placeholder panels for:

Chart types (line, bars, ticks).

Reports / stats.

Symbol selection.

Add AI button below Analysis:

Label: AI (Artificial Intelligence).

Placeholder dashboard for AI predictions (mirroring MetaTrader 5 view).

Placeholder for priority symbols list:

Vertical list layout below AI button.

For now, display sample symbols.
Dependencies: Phase 0 completed.
Priority: High (foundation for AI and analysis functionality).

Phase 2 — Settings Section (Integration & Customization)

Goal: Provide user controls for logins, API integration, and customization options.
Tasks:

MetaTrader 5 logins:

Display active accounts.

Option to add/remove accounts.

Third-party API placeholders:

Panels for API keys / credentials.

Customization placeholders:

Allow demo configuration of dashboard appearance.

Risk management settings:

Define global risk rules (e.g., max risk %, stop loss/take profit scaling).

Store settings locally or via user profile.
Dependencies: Phase 0 complete; can run in parallel with Phase 1.
Priority: High (supports market order auto-fill logic).

Phase 3 — Market Order Enhancements (Auto-fill Stop Loss / Take Profit)

Goal: Improve market order workflow with automated risk-based calculations.
Tasks:

Implement auto-fill logic for selected symbol:

Read current market price.

Calculate stop loss and take profit based on risk management settings.

Display calculated values in the UI fields (editable by user).

Ensure integration with existing volume, deviation, symbol selection features.

Optional AI/AR logic:

Use AI module to suggest SL/TP based on historical data or trend analysis.
Dependencies: Phase 2 (risk management settings must exist).
Priority: High (directly impacts trading workflow).

Phase 4 — Pending Order Enhancements

Goal: Extend auto-fill logic to pending orders.
Tasks:

Auto-calculate stop loss and take profit for pending order entries.

Option to use AR/AI-assisted analysis for symbol-specific adjustments.

Ensure UI validation prevents overlapping or invalid orders.
Dependencies: Phase 3 complete (reuses SL/TP logic and risk settings).
Priority: Medium-High (complements market order workflow).

Phase 5 — Activity Section Debug & Enhancements

Goal: Fix errors and improve display.
Tasks:

HTTP 422 error:

Investigate API response for Deals/Orders.

Ensure proper request payload and error handling.

Ensure Pending Orders section is fully visible at 90% UI scaling.

Validate open positions, deals, and order activity updates in real time.
Dependencies: Phase 0 (UI scaling), Phase 1 (Analysis section layout).
Priority: High (errors affect usability).

Phase 6 — Reports & Views (Chart / Bars / Ticks / Stats)

Goal: Enable full reporting functionality in Analysis & Market Order dashboards.
Tasks:

Implement charts and views for selected symbols:

Candlestick / OHLC.

Bar chart and tick data.

Statistical summaries.

Generate downloadable / exportable reports for each view.

Integrate with priority symbols and AI section for simultaneous display.
Dependencies: Phase 1 (Analysis section structured).
Priority: Medium (enhances analysis capability).

Phase 7 — AI Section (Predictive Dashboard)

Goal: Build predictive features in AI module.
Tasks:

Pull live symbol data from MetaTrader 5.

Run AI/AR predictions in real time:

Price trend forecasting.

Risk-adjusted suggestions.

Display AI predictions in dashboard format under AI section.

Connect to auto-fill for market/pending orders (optional, advanced).
Dependencies: Phases 1, 3, 4, 6 (data and calculations available).
Priority: Medium-High (future enhancement, can start with placeholders).

Implementation Notes / Considerations

Maintain current functionality; avoid breaking existing workflows.

Start with placeholders for AI & customization; full logic can be incrementally implemented.

Ensure all UI elements scale correctly at 90%.

Risk management and auto-fill logic are central for consistency in trading operations.
