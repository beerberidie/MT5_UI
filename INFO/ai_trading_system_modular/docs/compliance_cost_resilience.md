# Compliance, Cost & Resilience

## Compliance & Audit
- Keep logs of orders, fills, PnL, exceptions; exportable for tax.
- Respect leverage/CFD restrictions by jurisdiction.

## Cost
- Prefer free data: Yahoo, Stooq, Dukascopy, FRED, TradingEconomics, NewsAPI (free tier), RSS.
- Perplexity: rely on **Quick** mode & Spaces; conserve capped Pro/Deep queries.

## Resilience
- UPS + auto‑restart; hotspot failover.
- Broker or feed down → alerts + auto‑flat SOP.
