## 1. Account Balance & Lot Sizes

**Balance Assumed:** $100  
**Platform:** MT5  

- **1.00 lot** → $1 move = $100  
- **0.10 lot** → $1 move = $10  
- **0.01 lot (micro)** → $1 move = $1  
- **0.001 lot (nano, if broker allows)** → $1 move = $0.10  

### Risk Management
- **2% risk:** $2 per trade  
- **5% risk:** $5 per trade (max, aggressive)  

### Stop Loss Examples
- At **0.01 lot** → stop must be $2–$5 away (very tight).  
- At **0.001 lot** → stop can be $20–$50 away (more realistic).  

✅ **Conclusion:** Use 0.001 lots if broker allows; otherwise 0.01 lots only at strong support/resistance.

## 2. Timeframe Approach

- **Daily** → Macro trend (bullish/bearish bias).  
- **4H** → Main trading window (identify breakouts, pullbacks).  
- **1H / 15m** → Fine-tune entries/exits, watch momentum shifts.

## 3. Key Price Action Levels

- **Bullish Case:** Hold above $3,700–$3,720 → target $3,800 → $3,900 → $4,000.  
- **Bearish Case:** Rejection at $3,800 and close below $3,700 → pullback to $3,650–$3,500.  

Confirmation:
- **Bullish:** Strong closes above resistance, small rejection wicks.  
- **Bearish:** Repeated rejection, long upper wicks, divergence on RSI/MACD.

## 4. Best Trading Times (Daily/Weekly)

### Best Times (SAST = GMT+2)

### Worst Times
